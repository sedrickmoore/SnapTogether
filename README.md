# SnapTogether

This demo feature for an app based on Snapchat is set to connect users in underserved communities with opportunities crafted for them, as well as to promote local talent in their neighborhoods.

The project uses React Native within Expo. Expo GO is currently the best way to test the app. All data is written to Supabase. There are also other, smaller features, such as an astrology page that requires an API key from RapidAPI if interested.

Currently, the feature (and app) are setup simply to demonstrate the teams. In future iterations, more functionality may be included.
